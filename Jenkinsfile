// This deployment script assumes that there is only a single Jenkins server (master) and there are no agents.
// If the setup includes agents, then the stages should be reconfigured to take advantage of additional remote nodes.
// This script is assuming that you're using a multi-branch project but the majority directly translates to a regular pipeline project.
